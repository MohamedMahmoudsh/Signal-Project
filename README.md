# ECG Signal Classification

A project focused on classifying ECG signals using deep learning techniques.

## Description

This project is dedicated to the classification of ECG (Electrocardiogram) signals through the application of deep learning models. By leveraging advanced neural network architectures, the aim is to accurately identify different types of heart conditions from ECG data. This tool can assist in the early detection and diagnosis of cardiac anomalies, potentially saving lives by enabling timely medical intervention.
